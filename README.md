# LID-CVITY
This is a ME- Graduate Class project which involves the simulation of lid-driven cavity flow using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. The aim is to analyze the flow behavior within a square cavity driven by the motion of the top lid, focusing on the effects of Reynolds number on flow patterns and vortex formation. Implemented using  MATLAB, this project demonstrates the application of numerical methods to solve Navier-Stokes equations and visualize the resulting flow dynamics.
